    "**A self-service kiosk refers to a digital terminal that allows customers to independently place orders, customize their meals, and pay for their orders without having to deal with a cashier or employee directly. These kiosks often offer customer-friendly user interfaces, menu selections, and payment processing capabilities to make it easy and simple for customers to complete their orders. In the last several years, there has been a lot of discussion on how interactive kiosks and conventional customer service channels compare in the fast food business. Many fast food companies have implemented interactive kiosks as an alternate ordering option in addition to traditional cashier service due to the advancement of technology and the need for improved customer experiences.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**There have been several studies that have explored the impact of interactive kiosks on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction. An example includes that of Rastegar, Nazi where he conducted a study titled \"Adoption of Self-service Kiosks in Quick-service Restaurants.\" He found that the more customers are satisfied with the kiosk, the more likely they are to use kiosk service whenever available; and the more likely they are to encourage their friends and families to use it ^[rategar]. Similarly, this includes that of Melissa Harward examining how self-service kiosks are transforming the quick-service restaurant environment. Her study revealed that by providing a self-service option in addition to a traditional cashier and cash register, QSRs are able to reduce the number of people both waiting in line to order and standing around the counter waiting for their food ^[harward]. This suggests that interactive kiosks could offer long-term benefits to the establishments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Even though the studies mentioned above have shown the advantages of interactive kiosks, further investigation is still required to fully comprehend their effects. In order to fully understand the differences between interactive kiosks and more conventional customer service channels, it is crucial to consider the intricacies of efficeny, cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction. Additionally, customer preferences play a pivotal role in the adoption and success of kiosks. While some consumers could still appreciate personalized service and traditional human interactions, others might still prefer the speed and overall convenience of self-service through kiosks. The installation and marketing tactics for interactive kiosks may be tailored to better suit certain customer preferences by indentifying unique customer categoried based on demographic traits, eating choices, or technological literacy. Overall, while earlier research has provided a foundation for understanding the impact of interactive kiosks, more thorough and in-depth investigation is still required.**\n",

Self-service interactive kiosks offer the ability to increase efficiency by lowering wait times, enhancing order accuracy, and optimizing staffing demands. Additionally, we predict that the use of kiosks may result in considerable labor and operational cost reducations. To make sure that the advantages of kiosks are in line with user preferences, it is necessary to look at customer satisfation. We also anticipate that certain consumer demographics, such as younger generations, may favor interactive kiosks due to their familiarity with technology and a desire for a seamless and effective ordering experience.**"
