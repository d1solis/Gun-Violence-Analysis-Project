    "**Gun violence is a serious issue in the United States with significantly higher levels compared to many other developed countries along with many contributing factors. Previous studies have looked at the connections between poverty rates and access to mental health services. Research has also linked poverty to greater rates of violence and crime, especially using firearms. A lack of access to mental health treatments and unrelated mental illnesses have also been linked to an increased likelyhood of engaging in violent acts involving weapons. Understanding how these factors interact can help determine the most efficient methods for reducing gun violence.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**One relevant study by John Rozel and Edward Mulvey examined the link between mental illness and firearm violence, highlighting the fact that even though mental illness is a marginal risk factor for violence, untreated or inadequately managed mental health issues might make people more likely to act violently, especially by using guns. In order to reduce violence risk without stigmatizing people with mental illness, evidence-based public policy must be guided by mental health specialists who also educate patients on gun safety. Another study conducted by Nicole Kravitz-Wirtz among several others explored the relationship between deadly gun violence by poverty, finding that the increasing poverty levels in the households of specifically young people can have a negative impact in terms of high exposure to gun violence.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although research has looked at the specific relationships between poverty, mental health, and gun violence, a thorough study that takes many aspects into account is still necessary. By examining how poverty rates, access to mental health services, and other potential variables interact, we seek to close this gap by identifying the variables that have the strongest and most statistically significant correlations with gun violence at the state level in the United States.**\n",

Additionally, limited access to mental health services may result in untreated or under-treated mental illnesses, which can raise the risk of individuals using weapons in violent crimes.**"
