"The advancement of artificial intelligence, also known as AI, has significantly changed many technological industries. Most recently, one of the biggest breakthroughs in AI is the development of ChatGPT, which is a large language model. ChatGPT essentially generates human-like responses and offers the ability to automate a variety of tasks that require human input. However, this raises the question about how it would potentially affect the availability of jobs in the tech industry, specifically in the United States. There are few studies that have examined the effect of ChatGPT on job availability in the tech industry. For example, a study co-authored by OpenAI, the founders of ChatGPT, estimate that 15% of all tasks performed by the workforce in the United States might be performed significantly faster through LLMs. If additional complementary technologies are added, this figure could exceed half of all tasks [^warnke]. This implies that the integration of language models such as ChatGPT in the workplace has the potential to significantly impact the job market, as a large portion of tasks currently performed by human workers could be automated and completed more quickly by machines. This could lead to the displacement of some jobs and require workers to adapt their skills to stay relevant in the job market. Additionally this includes that of the Goldman Sachs study that two-thirds of all jobs in the United States will be at least partly affected by Generative AI (with 25% - 50% of their tasks potentially being automated) [^warnke]. Another example includes a study 2013 University of Oxford study found that 47% of US jobs could be eliminated by AI over the next 20 years, that prediction appears to have been off-base [^mok & zinkula]. This suggests that there is a degree of uncertainty when it comes to predicting the impact of AI on the job market. Almost half of all US jobs could be eliminated by AI over the next 2 decades, which would have had a significant impact on the economy and the job market. Moreover, a recent Goldman Sachs study found that generative AI tools could, in fact, impact 300 million full-time jobs worldwide, which could lead to a "significant disruption" in the job market [^mok & zinkula]. This highlights the need for ongoing research and analysis of the impact of AI on the job market. As AI technology continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, it is likely that the impact on the job market will continue to be a topic of concern and debate, and it will be important for researchers and policymakers to monitor these trends and adapt policies as needed."

"The ideal dataset would have information about job availability (i.e. quantitative info) for both prominent and lesser known companies as well as corresponding dates so we can track how job availability has changed throughout the development of chatGPT. These data would be collected by various organizations related to labor including the U.S. Bureau of Labor, Indeed, etc."

There shouldn’t be any privacy concerns because the datasets don’t give any specific information about who the identities of the survey respondents."
